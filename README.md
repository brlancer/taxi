Download and plot NYC Yellow Cab data
Brian Lance

### SUMMARY 

This script uses the 'bigrquery' package to download a table consisting  of 
NYC Yellow Cab pickups throughout the year 2014. I then use ggplot2 to make
nice looking taxi themed plots of the data which are ready for final touches
in Adobe Illustrator.

### CREDIT 

I owe all credit to Max Woolf's original plot

and Felipe Hoffa for sharing preliminary replication code
